PoreRT is distributed under the terms of the AGPLv3 License with the following clarification and special exception.

Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on this library.
Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU Affero General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library with independent
modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute
the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based
on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but
you are not obliged to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

See LICENSE-AGPL for the full license. You can see the previous MIT license at LICENSE-MIT.

I chose the AGPLv3 License due to it's compatibility with the GPLv3 and LGPLv3 Licenses
for Bukkit and Craftbukkit respectively. If you feel the AGPLv3 license prohibits your
use of this project, feel free to contact me.
